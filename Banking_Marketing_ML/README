Project Summary

Bank X aims to increase its borrower base to boost loan interest revenue. A recent marketing campaign had a single-digit conversion rate; the goal is to reach double digits without increasing the budget. This project will develop a machine learning model to predict potential customers likely to convert, using historical data. Targeting these high-probability customers will improve marketing efficiency and drive business growth.
